# üöÄ YOLOv8 CCTV Entry Detection with Timestamp Verification

This project uses **YOLOv8** and **Tesseract OCR** to detect individuals entering a workspace via CCTV footage. The script extracts a timestamp from the video, verifies if the person arrived on time (before 6:30 AM), and saves the detected frame.

## üìå Features:
‚úî **Real-time person detection** using YOLOv8  
‚úî **Extracts timestamp** from CCTV footage using OCR  
‚úî **Compares entry time** with a predefined cutoff (6:30 AM)  
‚úî **Saves detected frame** with a bounding box

## ‚ö° How to Run This Project on Google Colab

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Project in Google Colab**



---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload a CCTV Video**
Since Google Colab does not have direct access to local files, **you need to manually upload your video** when prompted.  

In the Colab notebook, run the following command to upload the video:  
```python
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()  # Select and upload the CCTV footage


3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Run the following command inside the Colab notebook to install required packages:

!pip install ultralytics opencv-python pytesseract

4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Detection Script
Once the dependencies are installed, execute the detection script:

!python main.py 

5Ô∏è‚É£ View the Detection Results
The detected frame will be saved as detected_entry.jpg.
You can download the image using:
from google.colab import files
files.download("detected_entry.jpg")
